# Natours

##### This is a react implementation of an HTML mocksite that an advanced CSS course goes over. The course strictly went over HTML & CSS styling. I took it upon myself to refactor the code into React components and modularized them for re-usability.

##### To run locally:

##### git clone this repo

##### run `npm install` in root directory

##### run `npm run build:dev` in root directory

##### run `npm run dev-server` in root directory

##### visit `localhost:3000` in browser
