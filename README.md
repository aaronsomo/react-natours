# Natours

##### This is a react implementation of an HTML mocksite that an advanced CSS course goes over. The course strictly went over HTML & CSS styling. I took it upon myself to refactor the code into React components and modularized them for re-usability.

##### To run locally:

##### git clone this repo

##### run `npm install`

##### run `npm run build:dev`

##### run `npm run dev-server`

###### Design belongs to **_Jonas Schmedtmann_**
